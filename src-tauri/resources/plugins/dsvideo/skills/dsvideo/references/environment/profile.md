# Configure the Runtime Profile

Read this when selecting a project's execution environment, wiring Endpoints and credentials,
setting shared capacity, or deciding when a configuration change takes effect.
[Models and Providers](model-and-provider.md) owns service choice and BYOK;
[local tools](local-tools.md) owns preparation and process management.

Go to [Profile selection](#create-a-profile-when-the-project-needs-one),
[configuration structure](#read-and-edit-the-actual-configuration),
[routing](#connect-model-capability-need-and-endpoint),
[credentials](#put-secrets-behind-credential-references),
[capacity](#set-capacity-at-the-resource-it-describes), or
[change effects](#know-when-a-change-takes-effect) as needed.

## Create a Profile when the project needs one

From the project directory:

```bash
dsvideo runtime init
dsvideo paths
```

`runtime init` writes and selects an editable starter `dsvideo.runtime.json`. It preserves an existing
Profile and performs no installation or login. Its hosted generation/alignment, local media and local
rendering entries are initial routing choices, not a requirement to prepare every service for every
video. Keep the entries and bindings appropriate to the work and the user's chosen setup.

Use `dsvideo runtime use <profile>` to record an existing Profile for this project.
`--runtime <profile>` selects one for a single invocation. Commands read the project's
`.dsvideo/runtime` selection file; they do not guess from a familiar filename or another project's
selection. From elsewhere, `dsvideo paths --workspace /path/to/project` inspects that project. The same
project option applies to environment commands and Build status/control. See the
[project boundary](../creation/project-files.md#establish-the-project-boundary).

Keep these locations distinct:

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Project directory | Sources, Runs, assets and component dependencies |
| `.dsvideo/runtime` | File naming the selected Profile |
| Profile file | Editable execution choices; may be shared intentionally |
| Profile `dataRoot` | Execution data, Worker state and working files; relative to the Profile's directory |
| Host state / Program Home | Machine-level prepared packages and helpers, reported by `dsvideo paths` |
| Project Result repository | Finished Results and Outputs; configured separately in `dsvideo.results.json` |

The selection file and execution directory must be different paths. CLI, Studio and creation
commands address the same project context; there is no second CLI environment to initialize.
Installed code, selected configuration and existing execution data remain separate.

## Read and edit the actual configuration

A complete minimal Profile for credential-free local media work is:

```json
{
  "format": "dsvideo.runtime-local@1",
  "dataRoot": ".dsvideo/execution",
  "credentials": {},
  "endpoints": {
    "media.local": {
      "use": "@dsvideo/provider-media-local"
    }
  },
  "bindings": {}
}
```

This selects media processing only. It needs compatible FFmpeg and FFprobe supplied by the host;
it does not install them, select an image model, or render HyperFrames pictures. Use it when those
are the actual requirements, not as a replacement for a production's existing Profile.

| Field | How to choose it |
| --- | --- |
| `credentials` | Named Credential Store adapters; empty when no selected Endpoint needs a secret |
| `endpoints` | Named Provider instances. `use` selects the package; its README defines `config` |
| `bindings` | Complete capability keys mapped to Endpoint instance names |
| Endpoint `pool` | Optional identity of a real shared account, deployment or compute quota |
| `dataRoot` | Where this Runtime keeps execution state; changing it selects different state |
| Optional `worker.executionMemoryMb` | Memory budget for Build execution processes; startup policy owned by the Runtime package |

Merge documentation fragments into the corresponding existing objects. Retain other services,
credential references and bindings the project uses. A fragment without `format` and `dataRoot`
is not a complete Profile. Package installation makes an adapter available; declaring it here
selects an instance. Configuration keys belong to that package, so a `baseUrl` or `apiKey` field
from one Provider is not a universal schema for all Providers.

## Connect Model, capability, Need and Endpoint

The [Model and Provider roles](model-and-provider.md#start-from-the-capability-the-work-needs)
keep authoring separate from deployment. One authored request produces a concrete external **Need**
only if its output remains demanded by the Run. Existing Result Candidates can satisfy that output
without another generation request.

A **capability** identifies the required operation. The Profile routes it to an **Endpoint**, a
configured Provider instance. A **binding** is that explicit routing choice. For example, after
declaring and configuring `whisperx.local`, merge:

```json
{
  "bindings": {
    "@dsvideo/whisperx@1#whisperx-alignment": "whisperx.local"
  }
}
```

Use the complete capability key from the Model/Provider vocabulary, not a vendor model label.
The named Endpoint must actually offer it and support the concrete request. One eligible Endpoint
needs no binding; several unbound choices are an error, not a fallback order. This lets the same
Source use local alignment in one deployment and hosted alignment in another.

Explicit bindings let capability-scoped commands load the named Endpoints directly. Without a
binding, discovering eligible implementations can require loading the declared Endpoint packages;
an uninstalled declared package can therefore block discovery. Correct the declaration or select
the intended binding. An unused account need not be logged in merely to resolve the work.

The complete local alignment example is in
[local WhisperX](local-tools.md#select-local-whisperx-explicitly). Hosted and BYOK examples are in
[service connections](model-and-provider.md). Result storage and project-package resolution are
separate from this routing.

## Use the Dsivio App's account configuration

The default Profile uses `@dsvideo/provider-dsivio` with `credentials: {}`. Enable image/video
models and configure their accounts in Dsivio Settings > 媒体创作. Keep Dsivio running.
The adapter calls `dsivio media`; it never reads App settings, owns an API key or requests a
Dsvideo auth login. Local media/rendering Endpoints also need no credentials.

```json
{
  "credentials": {},
  "endpoints": {
    "dsivio.media": { "use": "@dsvideo/provider-dsivio" }
  }
}
```

Run `dsivio media models` to inspect enabled models and `dsvideo doctor --endpoint dsivio.media`
to check the connection. Restart the Runtime after changing the enabled model pool so it loads
fresh descriptions. Paid usage is billed through the accounts configured in Dsivio.

The SDK's credential Stores remain available for explicitly installed custom Providers. Follow
that Provider's README for its credential references and Store choice; do not put keys into
Sources, Runs, Profile JSON, commits or chat.

## Set capacity at the resource it describes

The Runtime Worker advances Builds. HyperFrames `workers` counts Chrome processes inside one
render Need. These are different controls; there is no extra Build-wide model concurrency setting.

| Control | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Provider request capacity, commonly `config.defaultConcurrency` | Simultaneous Needs across Builds using the resource |
| Provider-specific model/action limits | Model quota or submit/poll/collect concurrency and rate; use that Provider's accepted fields |
| Endpoint `pool` | Shared resource identity for instances consuming the same real quota |
| HyperFrames `workers`, `maxWorkers` | Per-render Chrome count or automatic ceiling |
| HyperFrames `browserCapacity` | Shared Chrome budget alongside the whole-request budget |

For example, merge this Endpoint entry for an intentionally chosen render budget:

```json
{
  "endpoints": {
    "hyperframes.local": {
      "use": "@dsvideo/provider-hyperframes-local",
      "pool": "local-render",
      "config": {
        "defaultConcurrency": 2,
        "workers": 4,
        "browserCapacity": 6
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Only one four-browser request fits the six-browser budget at once, even though the request limit is
two. These numbers illustrate the relationship; choose them for the actual machine. HyperFrames
reserves both budgets until the whole render finishes, including preparation and encoding.
It does not release capacity each time one browser closes.

Instances sharing a pool must agree on its limits. Separate accounts do not share one merely because
they offer the same model. Capacity coordination covers Builds sharing a Runtime Execution Store;
it is not a cross-machine account quota service. Accepted asynchronous Operations retain their task
claim while pending. Short submit/poll/collect calls have separate action budgets when declared.
Ending a Build attempt releases local claims while retaining receipts and last known remote state;
it does not imply a remote task has been cancelled.

Use `dsvideo activity` when actual claims matter. The installed Runtime and Provider READMEs own the
exact settings. Studio's permitted transient work has session-local concurrency.

## Ask each command for the fact it owns

| Question | Command and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Which project, Profile and storage locations apply? | `dsvideo paths` |
| Is a named credential present? | `dsvideo auth status <endpoint>`; no account-access guarantee |
| What will this Run demand? | `dsvideo plan <run>`; concrete requests, support checks and cheap readiness of their selected Endpoints |
| Can the selected services be reached and used? | `dsvideo doctor --endpoint <instance>`; bounded active diagnosis, no generation submission |
| Is the Worker running and work active? | `dsvideo runtime status` |
| Which local helpers answer, and where are their logs? | `dsvideo programs status --endpoint <instance> --verbose` |

Choose the observation needed now; this is not a mandatory sequence before every operation.
Without a selected Profile, `doctor` checks project Results only. With one, it may contact remote
services for bounded diagnostics. `plan` does not actively probe remote services or install missing
resources. Neither command prepares every language model just because a local service is healthy.

Prepare the selected resources and start needed helpers through
[local Program commands](local-tools.md#let-the-selected-endpoint-own-its-program).
A missing capability can leave independent Script, reference or component work possible; explain
which requested outcome still depends on it. [Review](../production/review.md#show-what-the-current-work-establishes)
distinguishes useful intermediate evidence from the intended deliverable.

## Know when a change takes effect

| Change | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Source, Run or project component implementation | Create a new Build for the changed work |
| Endpoint config or binding | New Builds read current choices; an existing Build retains its selected configuration |
| Writable Store credential value | Subsequent credential resolution uses that Store; changing a secret is not a blanket Worker restart instruction |
| Distribution installation, Worker startup policy or its inherited environment | Restart the Worker explicitly when active work permits |
| A running local service's model, device, compute, batch size or cache location | Prepare its selected resources, then restart that helper when idle |
| Additional WhisperX alignment language in the same cache | Run scoped `programs prepare`; the service can stay running |
| Browser download mirror | Used for the next required preparation; a healthy cached browser remains usable |
| Profile used by an existing Studio session | Restart the session if it needs to load the edited selection |

A new Build's execution context is not a snapshot of every external file or service.
Read [Build execution scope](../production/builds.md#build-with-the-current-project-implementation)
before restarting a coordinator or changing dependencies during active work.
Do not restart everything after every edit, or expect a completed Build to rerun itself.

## Dsivio media

Select `dsivio.media` with `use: "@dsvideo/provider-dsivio"`; it needs no credential store, API key or service URL. Enable image/video models in Dsivio Settings > 媒体创作, then use `dsvideo doctor --endpoint dsivio.media`. Local Providers remain available.
